    <h2>Electoral Law</h2>
    <p>•	Elections in India are held and administered by The Election Commission. It is a constitutional authority for overseeing all electoral processes in the Republic of India.</p>
    <p>•	Established on January 25, 1950, the commission ensures the smooth and successful execution of elections, thereby upholding the democratic traditions of the nation.</p>
    <p>•    The legal framework for conducting elections and related activities is outlined in the Representation of People Act, 1950 and 1951.
    <p>•	India holds several types of elections including general elections, state legislative elections, and local body elections. General elections are held every five years to elect members to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. Voters choose representatives from constituencies across the country, with the leader of the majority party or coalition becoming the Prime Minister.
    <p>•	State elections are similarly conducted for the Vidhan Sabhas (state legislative assemblies). These elections determine the chief ministers and their governments at the state level. Local elections, on the other hand, focus on electing leaders to local bodies such as municipalities and panchayats.
        
        
        
    <h3>    First-time voting?</h3>
    <h4>    This is all you should know </h4>
        
        1.	As per the Indian law, when you turn 18, you are eligible to vote. </p>
        
        2.	You can only be enrolled as a voter at your ordinary place of residence. This means that you should register to vote in the constituency where you currently reside, which sums up to that You can only be registered at one place. If you have shifted from one place of residence to another within the same constituency, you can use Form 8 to update your details. This form allows you to shift your voter registration from one address to another within the same constituency.</p>
        
        3.	Government Identification proofs required for voting include a Voter ID card.
            However there are alternatives to that as well. The alternatives include:</p>
        •	Aadhaar card </p>
        •	MGNREGA job card </p>
        •	Bank or post office passbooks with photographs </p>
        •	 Health insurance smart card issued under the scheme of the Ministry of Labour </p>
        •	Driving licence </p>
        •	 PAN card </p>
        •	 Smart Card issued by RGI under NPR </p>
        •	 Passport</p>
        
        4.	Voting is done by EVM (Electronic Voting Machines) in the electoral poll areas in the presence of poll officers. Before EVM, a vote was given through ballot boxes, where voters mark their choices on paper ballots and then deposit them into the box.</p>
        
        5.	The Election Commission maintains a list of all registered voters called the electoral roll. Being listed in the electoral roll is a prerequisite to voting. Owning a voter ID card or a document prescribed by the Commission does not guarantee that you will be permitted to vote., until your name is present in the electoral roll.</p>
        
        6.	One method of voting in India should be adopted i.e. in sporadic and special cases, people can vote by post. This process is known as the Postal Ballot. People who are living overseas or due to certain reasons can go for this option. In many cases, army people are given this privilege and people live overseas. However, this is not yet a system in India or for Indians living overseas.</p>
        
        7.	For enrolment to a new fresh voter list, one needs a few documents like a PAN Card, Ration card, Voter ID, Indian passport, etc. The voter can be disqualified from giving vote under certain circumstances and a person can only vote once during an election.</p>
        
        8.	There are various voting rights given to every citizen of India like NOTA, Right to Know, Right to Refuse to Vote.</p>
        •	In Right to Know voters have the right to know about the candidate whom they are voting for.</p>
        •	In NOTA (None of the above) vote also known as Right Not to Vote, the voter votes for nobody. They take part in the elections but do not vote for any candidate or for any political parties. </p>
        •	Many electors are unaware of their right to “refuse to vote” even after registering their identities before the presiding officer. The electors can abstain from voting even after reaching the polling booth. While the NOTA (None Of The Above) option allows voters to express their lack of confidence in any of the candidates seeking mandate, the ‘refusal to vote’ option allows an elector to shun the poll process in its entirety.</p>
